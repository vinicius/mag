  2. Requirements

   JacORB 1.4.1 or greater - http://www.jacorb.org
   Ant 1.5 or greater - http://ant.apache.org
   Lua-5.0-Plus - http://incubadora.fapesp.br/projects/integrade/
   Compat-Lua-5.1-r5 - http://incubadora.fapesp.br/projects/integrade/
   OiL 0.3.1 - http://incubadora.fapesp.br/projects/integrade/ 

   Kerberos with all libraries and header files (OPTIONAL: If security
   for the Application Repository is desired).

   jdk 1.5 or greater - http://java.sun.com
   GNU gcc compiler 
   GNU Make with the following additional libraries and headers: 
    General purpose cryptographic C++ library (libcrypto++);
    Common error description library (comerr).



   The current version only works on the Linux platform, since there is no standard
   to obtain system information (e.g. CPU usage, free RAM) across various platforms. 
   This limitation will be solved in the future.


  3. Preparing for compilation

     After installing all the above requirements you are ready to setup InteGrade.

     IMPORTANT: If you wish to install Integrade with security enabled for the 
     Application Repository, you MUST install and configure Kerberos FIRST. You have 
     also to create grid user accounts in ARSC realm.
     For more details about Kerberos and security check the Kerberos Tutorial for 
     InteGrade (available soon at http://integrade.incubadora.fapesp.br)

     The setup.sh script will help you on configuring InteGrade. You have two options: 

     a) Run setup.sh without any arguments and answer some questions. 
        The provided information will be saved on the setup.conf file (for future reuse).
	OR
     b) You can directly edit the setup.conf file and make it suitable for your 
        environment. Then run setup.sh with "--file setup.conf".

     More information can be found running "setup.sh --help".


  4. Compiling InteGrade

     To compile all the InteGrade modules:

        make


   5. Executing the InteGrade modules

      Nowadays Integrade must be configured and compiled in all grid machines.
      After this, you can start Integrade services with the startservices.sh script.

        In one of the machines (where you will start all servers), type:

          ./startservices.sh servers

        In each machine that will be part of the grid, type:

          ./startservices.sh lrm

        In one of the machines that will be used for submitting and executing
        grid applications, type:

          ./startservices.sh asctGui

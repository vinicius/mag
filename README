README - InteGrade Version 0.3
----------------------------------

InteGrade project is a multi-university effort to build a novel Grid Computing
middleware infrastructure that leverages the idle computing power of personal
workstations. InteGrade features an object-oriented architecture based on the
CORBA industry standard for distributed objects.  InteGrade also strives to
ensure that users who share the idle portions of their resources in the Grid
shall not perceive any loss in the quality of service provided by their
applications.  Finally, InteGrade also supports the reliable execution of
parallel applications that requires communication among the application
processes.

InteGrade currently supports three different classes of applications:
sequential, parametric (parameter sweep applications) and BSP.  Sequential applications are
composed of a binary that executes on a single machine.  Parametric applications
are also composed of a single binary, but multiple copies of the same binary are
executed, each with its own input parameters.  Finally, the BSP applications are
programmed according to the Bulk Synchronous Parallel computing model, which
divides the computation in supersteps, each of them composed of computation,
communication, and finished with a mandatory synchronization barrier.

InteGrade is an official "Incubadora Virtual da FAPESP" project. Source code and
documentation are hosted at:
